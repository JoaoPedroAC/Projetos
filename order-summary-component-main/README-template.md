## Overview
I thinked so this project will be simple, but It isn't, if you dont'n to think much in a good strategy will frustraded yourself.

### The challenge

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
When I looked first time, thinked, its is so much easy, but dont were, maked a lot of time that I don't used HTML and CSS and accepted this project for test me, and frustraded me, but with percistence and dedication, finished with much pride, I remembered a lot of things and I ran behide more information that I don't knew for finally finished the amazing project. 

### Built with

- HTML

### What I learned

I lerned a little more about reosponsive and some function of css like:

`` CSS 
div.single-part:nth-child(2) {
    width: 40%;
    padding: 0% 2%;
    transform: translateX(-15%);
}

and

 @media screen and (max-width: 1320px) {
    section .area {
        background-color: white;
        width: 30%;
        top: center;
        left: 12%;
    }
    /* icone */
    div.single-part:nth-child(1) {
        width: 20%;
        padding: 0 10px;
    }
    /* texto */
    div.single-part:nth-child(2) {
        width: 40%;
        padding: 0% 2%;
        transform: translateX(-10%);
    }
    /* link */
    div.single-part:nth-child(3) {
        width: 30%;
        padding: 3% 0;
        transform: translateX(15%);
    }
